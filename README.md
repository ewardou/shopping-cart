The goal of this project was to create a single-page app using React-Router. The idea was to create an online shop with a catalog of products, and a cart where the user can edit and confirm the order.

I decided to build a store around sneakers. It has two main sections (home and shop), individual pages for each product, and the shopping cart modal. I also took this as an opportunity to practice testing of react components.
